# Serine Identification Service
### The place to deliver information about Serine-Protocol virtual devices

First, you develop your devices using [Serine Protocol](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/Serine-Protocol) and temporary identification tags. Then you send an e-mail to claudemi@iq.usp.br asking for permanent IDs (how many you want). A folder for each virtual device will be created with a sub-folder for the first version of it. Inside this folder, you will add the usage manual for your device as well as any other useful information you want to share about it (electric diagram, photos, and so on).
